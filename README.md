# Paper-Predictor
This repository contains the code for the arXiv.org citation predictive model. 
This project aims to create a Predictive model of how Scientific Paper content affects the lifetime number of citations the paper receives. Although the feasibility and validity of such a model are not known, it should with all haste be attempted none the less.

Project to-do is as follows 
1.) Download bulk Scientific Papers from https://arxiv.org/ 
2.) Clean papers and compile into a dataset 
3.) Brainstorm best methods to create a predictive model of how paper content affects the lifetime number of citations 
4.) Test various methods 
5.) Compare results 
6.) Publish results 
7.) Maintain an update as better methods are revealed
